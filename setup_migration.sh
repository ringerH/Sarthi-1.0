# This script automates the file and directory setup for the auth-service migration.
# It performs three main tasks:
# 1. Creates the new directory structure for the microservices.
# 2. Copies the relevant authentication files from the monolith to the new service.
# 3. Creates the necessary new (empty) files you will populate later.
